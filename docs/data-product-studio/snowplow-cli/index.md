Snowplow CLI brings data management elements of Snowplow Console into the command line. It allows you to download your data structures and data products to YAML/JSON files and publish them back to Console. This enables git-ops-like workflows, with reviews and branching.

# Install

Snowplow CLI can be installed with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```
brew install snowplow/taps/snowplow-cli
```

Verify the installation with
```
snowplow-cli --help
```

For systems where homebrew is not available binaries for multiple platforms can be found in [releases](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cli/releases).

Example installation for `linux_x86_64` using `curl`

```bash
curl -L -o snowplow-cli https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cli/releases/latest/download/snowplow-cli_linux_x86_64
chmod u+x snowplow-cli
```

Verify the installation with
```
./snowplow-cli --help
```

# Configure

You will need three values.

An API Key Id and the corresponding API Key (secret), which are generated from the [credentials section](https://console.snowplowanalytics.com/credentials) in BDP Console.

The organization ID, which can be retrieved from the URL immediately following the .com when visiting BDP console:

Snowplow CLI can take its configuration from a variety of sources. More details are available from `./snowplow-cli data-structures --help`. Variations on these three examples should serve most cases.

  <TabItem value="env" label="env variables" default>

  ```bash
  SNOWPLOW_CONSOLE_API_KEY_ID=********-****-****-****-************
  SNOWPLOW_CONSOLE_API_KEY=********-****-****-****-************
  SNOWPLOW_CONSOLE_ORG_ID=********-****-****-****-************
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="defaultconfig" label="$HOME/.config/snowplow/snowplow.yml" >

  ```yaml
  console:
    api-key-id: ********-****-****-****-************
    api-key: ********-****-****-****-************
    org-id: ********-****-****-****-************
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="args" label="inline arguments" >

  ```bash
  ./snowplow-cli data-structures --api-key-id ********-****-****-****-************ --api-key ********-****-****-****-************ --org-id ********-****-****-****-************
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Snowplow CLI defaults to yaml format. It can be changed to json by either providing a `--output-format json` flag or setting the `output-format: json` config value. It will work for all commands where it matters, not only for `generate`.

### Configure yaml lsp (optional)

During the authoring process it's convenient to have the editor highlight the errors, suggest possible values and show examples.
All files generated by the snowplow-cli's `generate` and `download` will contain a special comment as part of the file. This comment can be interpreted by the YAML Language server to add the above-mentioned functionality. In VS Code it can be achieved by installing [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml). Instructions for other editors can be found [here](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server?tab=readme-ov-file#clients).

After that running `snowplow-cli ds generate test` and opening the generated file in the configured editor of choice should look something like the following:
